****************************************************************************
* hwloc 1.11.8 has encountered an incorrect PCI locality information.
* PCI bus 0000:80 is supposedly close to 2nd NUMA node of 1st package,
* however hwloc believes this is impossible on this architecture.
* Therefore the PCI bus will be moved to 1st NUMA node of 2nd package.
*
* If you feel this fixup is wrong, disable it by setting in your environment
* HWLOC_PCI_0000_80_LOCALCPUS= (empty value), and report the problem
* to the hwloc's user mailing list together with the XML output of lstopo.
*
* You may silence this message by setting HWLOC_HIDE_ERRORS=1 in your environment.
